# Cornerz

A challenging word puzzle game inspired by NY Times Connections, built with Angular. Players arrange words in a 3x3 grid where each word must belong to both its row category and column category simultaneously.

## Features

- **Interactive Drag & Drop**: Intuitive word placement using Angular CDK
- **Dual-Category Logic**: Each word must satisfy both row and column categories
- **Multiple Puzzle Sets**: Various themed word collections with different difficulty levels
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Requires analytical thinking and creative word association
- **Clean UI**: Modern, minimalist interface focused on puzzle-solving

## Game Mechanics

Cornerz is a sophisticated word puzzle that challenges players to think in multiple dimensions. The game presents a 4x4 grid with 12 outer spots where each position must be filled with a word that satisfies **two categories simultaneously**.

### How It Works

The puzzle has **6 total categories** organized into two sets:
- **Category Set A**: Three categories that can be assigned to rows or columns
- **Category Set B**: Three categories that can be assigned to the remaining rows or columns

Players can choose whether Category Set A represents rows or columns, making the puzzle flexible and allowing multiple solution approaches.

Each word in the grid must belong to **both** its row category **and** its column category, creating a complex web of interconnected meanings.

### Game Mechanics

```
4x4 Grid (X = available spots, O = disabled center spots):

X X X X
X O O X  
X O O X
X X X X

Drag 4 words to form complete lines:
- Top Row (positions 0,1,2,3)
- Bottom Row (positions 12,13,14,15)
- Left Column (positions 0,4,8,12)
- Right Column (positions 3,7,11,15)

If all 4 words belong to the same category, they turn GREEN and lock in place.
Otherwise, they automatically return to the tile bank.
Any line can be any category!

üéØ VISUAL INDICATORS:
When a line is completed, the corresponding center square shows:
- Top Row ‚Üí Top Right center (arrow ‚Üë + category name)
- Right Column ‚Üí Bottom Right center (arrow ‚Üí + category name)  
- Bottom Row ‚Üí Bottom Left center (arrow ‚Üì + category name)
- Left Column ‚Üí Top Left center (arrow ‚Üê + category name)
```

In this example:
- **CHEDDAR** works because it's both slang for money (column) and a type of cheese (row)
- **BROWN** works because it's a color (column) and a bakery term (row)
- **CHECKER** works because it's something that rolls (column) and a musician's last name (row)

### The Challenge

The brilliance of Cornerz lies in finding words that can satisfy dual categories. Players must:

1. **Analyze Categories**: Understand what each row and column category represents
2. **Find Intersections**: Identify words that logically fit both their row and column themes
3. **Strategic Placement**: Position words to create a coherent, solvable grid
4. **Verify Logic**: Ensure every word makes sense within both of its assigned categories

### Adding New Puzzles

To add new puzzle sets, edit `src/assets/puzzles.json`. Each puzzle defines two category sets where each word appears exactly once in each set, allowing flexible row/column assignment:

```json
{
  "puzzles": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Your New Puzzle",
      "description": "Brief description of the puzzle theme",
      "words": [
        "WORD1", "WORD2", "WORD3",
        "WORD4", "WORD5", "WORD6", 
        "WORD7", "WORD8", "WORD9"
      ],
      "categorySetA": [
        {
          "name": "First Category A",
          "words": ["WORD1", "WORD2", "WORD3"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Second Category A", 
          "words": ["WORD4", "WORD5", "WORD6"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Third Category A",
          "words": ["WORD7", "WORD8", "WORD9"]
        }
      ],
      "categorySetB": [
        {
          "name": "First Category B",
          "words": ["WORD1", "WORD4", "WORD7"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Second Category B",
          "words": ["WORD2", "WORD5", "WORD8"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Third Category B",
          "words": ["WORD3", "WORD6", "WORD9"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each word must appear exactly once in categorySetA and once in categorySetB, creating the dual-category constraint that makes the puzzle challenging.

### Component Overview

- **GameBoardComponent**: Main game interface handling the 3x3 grid and tile bank
- **GameTileComponent**: Individual draggable word tiles
- **GameService**: Manages puzzle data loading and retrieval

## Playing the Game

1. **Select a Puzzle**: Use URL parameter `?puzzle=1` (or 2, 3) to choose a puzzle set
2. **Study the Categories**: Examine the row and column headers to understand the 6 different categories
3. **Drag Words**: Click and drag word tiles from the bank to positions on the 3x3 grid
4. **Think Dual-Purpose**: Each word must logically fit both its row category AND column category
5. **Rearrange**: Move words between grid positions or back to the bank as you refine your solution
6. **Verify Connections**: Ensure every placement makes logical sense for both intersecting categories

### Strategy Tips

- **Start with Obvious Intersections**: Look for words that clearly fit specific row/column combinations
- **Work Systematically**: Focus on one category at a time, then verify the perpendicular connections
- **Think Creatively**: Some words may have multiple meanings or interpretations that satisfy categories
- **Use Process of Elimination**: If a word doesn't work in one position, try it elsewhere
